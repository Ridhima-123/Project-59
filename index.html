        <p> Toothless is a dragon from the movie and book "How To Train Your Dragon" by Cressida Cowell.
            He is called toothless because it look as if he has no teeth but when he eats they suddenly appear. He is owned by Hiccup Haddock, a young Viking boy who is fearless but shy at times. Toothless is also the only Nightfury found in history. He was discovered by Hiccup.
            Toothless appears as a Night Fury in the franchise, the rarest, fastest and most intelligent species of Dragon there is. He is also the only known member of his species to date. He plays a similar role to his book counterpart.</p>
